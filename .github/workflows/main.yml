# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:

  # This workflow contains a job called "CIsetup"

    # The type of runner that the job will run on

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:

    # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2

    # Checks-out the ability to run a python program here
    - uses: actions/setup-python@v1
