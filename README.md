This Python program is a project attempting to compare user film ratings on Letterboxd to determine how "similar" two users are. It has two modes of running:

- Comparing two given users to each other
- Comparing a given user with either the people they are following, or the people following them

To run, you just need the file "user_film_compare.py":

`python user_film_compare.py`

Written using python 3.7.

Tested successfully on python 3.6, 3.7, 3.8

Python 3.5 seems to fail because of a problem with importing matplotlib.
